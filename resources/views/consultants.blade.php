        <h5>My name is Geoff Chen and I am a private consultant for international student placement. I attended Emory University majoring in Economics and Philosophy, as well I hold credentials from the TESOL International Association. Prior to becoming a private consultant I was the director for student placement with ALY International and I was also given the opportunity to work with AIC for collegiate student placement. I have a working relationship with the schools in the Orlando, Florida area and based on your recommendation to any of the schools chosen I would be more than happy to work side by side with you and the school for a smooth transition. </h5>
